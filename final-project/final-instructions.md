# Final Project Requirements Document

Your final project for this course will draw on all of the skills you've learned in this course, including:

* Practicing principles of good web design.
* Building web pages that look good on a range of devices.
* Using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.
* Asking interesting questions that serve as the basis for reporting
* Finding stories in data and finding data online with which to answer questions
* Using Excel for data analysis.
* Selecting the right technique to visualize data and telling compelling visual stories.
* Building interactive maps with Google Fusion Tables.
* Building interactive charts with Highcharts.
* Connecting your pages to the social web and analytics tools.
* The ability to debug problems using resources available on the web.

### Scope
Your final project will be to submit a link to a six-page website package, hosted on your GitHub pages site.  It will include:  

* Home Page
* Resume (Already built, but can redesign)
* Portfolio
* Final Story Project
* Germany World Cup (Already built)
* Our favorite movies (Already built)

### Home Page
This will serve as a future employer's introduction to you. It should have the following elements:

* Your name, in a big display font.
* A two to three sentence introduction, focused on your career.
* Your picture (unless you're uncomfortable with this, do not include)
* Icon buttons that link to your Twitter account, LinkedIn account, email and phone (if you're uncomfortable with any of these, do not include).
* A top menu that has your name in the upper left (linked to home page), "About" (linked to home page), "Resume" (linked to Resume) and "Portfolio" (linked to Portfolio page)
* Social sharing buttons for Facebook and Twitter with appropriate "Open Graph" meta tags to control how page looks when shared on social platforms.

### Portfolio
This will show future employers what you are capable of. It should include:

* The words Selected Works as a page headline
* Links to at least six and no more than 10 of your best journalism works. Do not include everything you've ever done.
* Links to the movies and Germany World Cup pages, and your final story. Do not count these in your list of six to 10 works.
* Each entry should include a headline hyperlinked to the original source, a sentence of introduction to explain what the story is (could be the lede or the anchor intro if it's a broadcast piece), and one or two sentences that explains WHY this is your best, because it's not always obvious (showed great initiative in reporting, shows your creative shooting ability, was exclusive, broke some news, et cetera.)
* A menu (identical to one on resume, home), that has your name, the words About (linked to home page), Portfolio (linked to Portfolio page) and Resume (linked to Resume).
* Social sharing buttons for Facebook and Twitter with appropriate "Open Graph" meta tags to control how page looks when shared on social platforms.

### Resume

You've already built your resume. But you may need to make some changes to your existing resume to allow it to fit in with your larger site.

### Guidelines for Home Page, Portfolio Page, Resume Page
The design you choose (font pairings, color schemes, et cetera) should be similar for all three pages. If you don't like how your resume looked and you want different design for your home and portfolio, you should change your resume to fit.

How you lay it out within that is up to you. You should use the Bootstrap web framework, but your final product should not look like "default" Bootstrap design. Here are some general rules:

* Wireframe before starting to build.
* Make smart use of design elements -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- color, value, texture, shape, form, space, line and type.
* Adhere to design principles -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Web Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- Contrast, Emphasis, Balance, Unity, Pattern, Movement, Rhythm and Repetition, Proportion, Simplicity and Gradation.
* The design should feel smart, professional and modern. Color should be use sparingly, primarily as accents. When in doubt, use white. For help selecting color palates that work well together, use [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/) or [Coolors]( href="http://coolors.co/")
* All three pages should look good at the four breakpoints that are part of the Bootstrap framework (Mobile phones, browser less than 768px; Tablets, 768px - 991px; Small desktops, 992px - 1199px; Large desktops, greater than 1200px). The page should WORK at all sizes, with appropriate margin and padding, things should line up correctly. It should not look broken. Use the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).
* At least one Google Font family and no more than two total font families.
* A footer with your name and copyright.
* All three pages should share a single stylesheet and single script.js file.
* At least 15 CSS comments per page.
* At least 10 HTML comments per page.
* Use proper indentation in HTML and CSS.
* Avoid using "heading" tags.  
* Make sure all tags are closed.  
* Use class and ID tags that are descriptive.
* Use as little code as possible to create your design.  Don't repeat yourself when possible. Be efficient.
* Make at least 10 commits to GitHub during construction.
* Social sharing buttons for Facebook and Twitter with appropriate "Open Graph" meta tags to control how page looks when shared on social platforms.

## Final Story Project

Your final story project will require you to build a single-page data story package that combines text and data visualizations, similar to the Germany World Cup and movies packages.   

But unlike those projects, in which you were given the idea and the data, this will require you to:

* Independently come up with a topic to explore, developing a big overarching question.
* Independently find data to interview, analyze it to find answers, and translate those answers into points to share with users.
* Independently write custom text and build data visualizations.
* Independently design a story package.

## Examples of overarching questions

* If you're in to politics, you might try to get a sense of just how unpopular Donald Trump is, in historic terms.
* If you're into sports, you might try to answer the question: why has the Washington NFL team been so consistently terrible for 20 years?
* If you're into music, you might ask: how has an artist I love changed as he or she's aged, based on setlist data?
* If you're into economics, you might ask: why has income inequality in the past two generations changed so drastically?

For students also taking 320/620 this summer, you will coordinate your final project with a story in that class.

## Story project minimum standards

Your project should:

* Be interesting and newsworthy!
* Show evidence of custom data analysis, using Excel formulas, including concatenate (you'll prove this by turning in your raw data and your spreadsheet calculations)
* Include at least three data visualizations built with HighCharts.
* Include at least one choropleth map.  
* Include at least one other data visualization using a javascript library or other tool NOT previously used in this class.   
* Include one advanced element using jQuery (i.e. scrollspy, tabbed section, slideshow carousel, et cetera).
* Include social sharing buttons for Facebook and Twitter with appropriate "Open Graph" meta tags to control how page looks when shared on social platforms.

## Story project page design

The story project page you design should:

* Have a headline, subhead, byline and dateline.  
* For students pairing with a story from 320/620, you should have at least one photograph.
* Each visualization element should have its own headline, contextual explainer text -- between one and three sentences -- and source information.  It should be placed on the page in way that works with flow of text on the page.
* Include a main headline, a small amount of text to set it up, and titles for each visualization and contextual text.

How you lay out the page is up to you. You should use the Bootstrap web framework, but your final product should not look like "default" Bootstrap design. Here are some general rules:

* Wireframe before starting to build.
* Make smart use of design elements -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- color, value, texture, shape, form, space, line and type.
* Adhere to design principles -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Web Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- Contrast, Emphasis, Balance, Unity, Pattern, Movement, Rhythm and Repetition, Proportion, Simplicity and Gradation.
* The design should feel smart, professional and modern. Color should be use sparingly, primarily as accents. When in doubt, use white. For help selecting color palates that work well together, use [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/) or [Coolors]( href="http://coolors.co/")
* All three pages should look good at the four breakpoints that are part of the Bootstrap framework (Mobile phones, browser less than 768px; Tablets, 768px - 991px; Small desktops, 992px - 1199px; Large desktops, greater than 1200px). The page should WORK at all sizes, with appropriate margin and padding, things should line up correctly. It should not look broken. Use the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).
* At least one Google Font family and no more than two total font families.
* A footer with your name and copyright.
* At least 15 CSS comments.
* At least 10 HTML comments.
* Use proper indentation in HTML and CSS.
* Avoid using "heading" tags.  
* Make sure all tags are closed.  
* Use class and ID tags that are descriptive.
* Use as little code as possible to create your design.  Don't repeat yourself when possible. Be efficient.
* Make at least 10 commits to GitHub during construction.

## Resources and Working Together
This project is 100 percent open book. You may use anything you find on the web, information from previous assignments, code from previous assignments. You may ask questions on web forums and use the answers you are provided. You may ask other classmates for help or guidance. You may work together, side-by-side. You may ask me for help as well.

If you use code from someone else on the web, you should be sure to give them credit with an HTML comment or a CSS comment. There are lots of great Bootstrap Templates out there that might serve as a good starting point. Feel free to use one, though I'll expect you'll need to make a lot of custom modifications to it.

One caveat: you should NOT simply copy code from another classmate. Feel free to work together, and if you arrive at the same answer, that's fine, but DO NOT SIMPLY COPY something someone has already done. If someone asks you for help, you should try to guide them to the answer, showing how you arrived at the answer (what you searched, what forum you found, what you tried), before just giving them the answer. In other words, lay a trail of breadcrumbs to help them get there at first.

  * A rough draft of supporting headlines and explainer text for each point.
* **3 percent | Friday, August 11 (Start of class)**:   
At least two of your interactive elements built and put onto your story-project HTML page on GitHub. The page need not be otherwise designed at this point, I just want to see interactive elements at this point.
* **3 percent | Monday, August 14 (Start of class)**:
All interactive elements built and put onto your story-project HTML page on GitHub. The page need not be otherwise designed at this point, I just want to see interactive elements at this point.   
* **3 percent | Wednesday, August 16 (Start of class)**:
Completed six-page site package (about, resume, portfolio, story-project, Germany World Cup, movies) finished and uploaded to your GitHub pages site, posting link to ELMS. You should consider this site *finished* at this point, not a draft, though your classmates and I may give you feedback on ways to improve it before final submission.    
* **2 percent | Wednesday, August 16 (End of class)**: Complete comprehensive peer-review of a classmate's site, offering detailed feedback, post to ELMS and share with your classmate.
