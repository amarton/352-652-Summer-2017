Step 1 - One Page Outline
3% - One page outline of exploration for proposed project, due Monday August 8 at start of class. Include topic, overall question to be answered, specific questions to ask, list of data sets that you plan to use, initial viz ideas. (Submitted through ELMS)

Step 2 - Full DETAILED Interactives List and DATA
Upload, AS A COMMENT, the following DETAILED information:

--Full list of interactives to be built, with a detailed description of what each will show, including, what point the graphic is attempting to convey, what specific data will be shown, what type of visualization will be used, what data is on what axis, how you'll use color (not specific colors, just it's purpose).  The more detail the better.

--A draft title for the graphic and a draft of a few sentences of text that will be used on the page to put in context.

--I cannot stress enough that these should be DETAILED.  I should basically be able to see these in my mind.  After I approve them, you should be able to immediately start building.

Then, Upload to ELMS, the Excel Spreadsheet that contains the specific formatted data for EACH graphic (map, three highcharts, one alternative viz type).  For example, if you plan to show the percentage of 18-24 voters who turned out in the last five presidential elections, you would have two columns (one for year, one for the percentage of 18-24 voters), and five rows (one for 2012, 2008, 2004, 2000, 1996).

Step 3 - Completed Interactives and Text
Due at the start of class is a a completed near-final draft of ALL interactive elements and text and a cleaned up data analysis Excel file. Upload the excel file here, and put a link to your draft project folder on your server in a comment.


Step 4 - Completed Draft of Final Site for Peer Review
Part 1 - 3 percent of grade - Upload a link to the completed near final draft of your site.  You should have three pages linked by a common menu:

Home (About)
Portfolio
Resume
From the portolio page, there should be a link to your final story project, and that link should e active with all of your visualizations, texts and well designed page.

This is due by the start of class.

*****

Part 2 - 3 percent of grade -- You will be assigned, at the beginning of class, someone's page to peer review.  Please list a minimum of 10 things that need to be fixed to make the page perfect.  This can be copy editing, AP style, unclear text, media queries not working, broken elements. You are looking for bugs.  Please make these thoughtful, good, and fully descriptive.  The more information you provide the better.

This is due by the end of class p.m.


Step 5 - Completed Final Draft of Site for Instructor
Upload a link to the completed final draft of your site.

Your site should be FINISHED at this point - your code, your design, page structure, text and interactives should all be, in your mind, finished. You will have one more day to finish polishing it up, but you should be doing just that on Thursday during class and after class -- polishing, fixing bugs.

Please review the requirements to make sure you have everything.

You should have three pages linked by a common menu:

Home (About)
Portfolio
Resume
From the portfolio page, there should be a link to your final story project, and that link should be active with all of your visualizations, texts and well designed page.

This is due by 8 p.m., so I have time to give you feedback tomorrow before class.


*****

Your final project for this course will draw on all of the skills you've learned in this course, including:

Practicing principles of good web design.
Building web pages that look good on a range of devices.&nbsp;
Using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery.
Asking interesting questions that serve as the basis for reporting
Finding stories in data and finding data online with which to answer questions
Using Excel for data analysis.
Selecting the right technique to visualize data and telling compelling visual stories.
Building interactive maps with Google Fusion Tables.
Building interactive timelines with Timelines.js.
Building interactive charts with Highcharts.
Connecting your pages to the social web and analytics tools.
The ability to debug problems using resources available on the web.
Scope
You will submit a link to a six page website package that are linked together, with the following pages:

Home Page
Portfolio
Resume (Already built)
Final Story Project
Germany World Cup (Already built)
Movies Story (Already built)
Home Page
This will serve as a future employer's introduction to you.

It should have the following elements:

Your name, in a big display font.
A two to three sentence introduction, focused on your career.
Your picture (unless you're uncomfortable with this, then don't worry about it!)
Icon buttons that link to your Twitter account, LinkedIn account, Email and Phone (if you're worried about it having your phone or email out there, don't include).
A menu (identical to one on resume, portfolio), that has your name, the words About (linked to home page), Portfolio (linked to Portfolio page) and Resume (linked to Resume)
Portfolio
This will allow future employers to see what you are capable of.

It should include:

The words Selected Works as a page headline
Links to at least six and no more than 10 of your best journalism works. Do not include EVERYTHING you've ever done, just your best.
You should also link to the Movies project, Germany world cup project and Final project in a similar fashion. Do not count these in your list of six to 10 works.
Each story and project should include the headline hyperlinked to the original source, a sentence of introduction to explain what the story is (could be the lede or the anchor intro if it's a broadcast piece), and one or two sentences that explains WHY this is your best, because it's not always obvious (showed great initiative in reporting, shows your creative shooting ability, was exclusive, broke some news, et cetera.)
A menu (identical to one on resume, home), that has your name, the words About (linked to home page), Portfolio (linked to Portfolio page) and Resume (linked to Resume).
Design Of Home Page, Portfolio Page, Resume Page
Above all, the design should look similar to, and work in concert with, the resume page you already designed. If you don't like how your resume looked and you want different design for your home and portfolio, you should change your resume to work together.

How you lay it out within that is up to you. You should use the Bootstrap web framework, but your final product should not look like "default" Bootstrap design.

Wireframe before starting to build.

Make smart use of design elements -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Design Aesthetics -- color, value, texture, shape, form, space, line and type.

Adhere to design principles -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Web Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- Contrast, Emphasis, Balance, Unity, Pattern, Movement, Rhythm and Repetition, Proportion, Simplicity and Gradation.

The design should feel smart, professional and modern.

Color should be use sparingly, primarily as accents.  The color scheme and font scheme for all the data visualizations should work together. Do not design them independently, in this regard. For help selecting color palates that work well together, use Color Scheme Designer (Links to an external site.) or Coolors (Links to an external site.). For help selecting Google Fonts that work together, try this page (Links to an external site.) or this page (Links to an external site.).

It should look good at the four breakpoints that are part of the Bootstrap framework (Mobile phones, browser less than 768px; Tablets, 768px - 991px; Small desktops, 992px - 1199px; Large desktops, greater than 1200px).

The page should WORK at all sizes, with appropriate margin and padding, things should line up correctly. It should not look BROKEN. You will lose a lot of points if it looks broken.

Menu - Use a top menu similar to the one on your Germany World Cup Page. Text Should Read "Our Favorite Movies" with the word TOP and numbers after it, one number for each visualization. When you click on those numbers, the page should jump down to that section. Hint: you'll need to use something called anchor tags. Look it up.

Footer - Use a footer with your name and copyright.

Bootstrap - Use the Bootstrap web framework, meaning you must use rows and columns.

Fonts - Use TWO google fonts and no more than three total fonts. Use the same fonts on all three of these pages.

Media Queries - A minimum of ten style changes as a result of media queries on these three pages.

Final Story Project
Of the three pages you have to build, this will require the most work. It will be similar in scope to the Germany World Cup page and the Movies page you have already built -- a single page story project that uses data and data visualization to answer interesting questions.

But unlike those projects, in which you were given the idea and the data, this will require you to:

Come up with a topic to explore and a central organizing question.
Find data to answer your questions, do data analysis and come up with editorial points to make.
Write custom text and build data visualizations with the answers to those questions.
Weave it together in one compelling package.
Looking for general ideas (you can't use these, but use them as a guide):

If you're in to politics, you might look at how Donald Trump shocked the GOP establishment by winning the party's nomination.
If you're into sports, you might try to answer the question: why has the Washington NFL team been so consistently terrible for 20 years?
If you're into music, you might ask: how has an artist I love changed as he or she's aged?
If you're into economics, you might ask: why has income inequality in the past two generations changed?
For students also taking 320/620 this summer, you have the option of coordinating this project with a story in that class.

At a minimum, every project must:

Be interesting and newsworthy!
Show evidence of custom data analysis (you'll prove this by turning in your raw data and your spreadsheet calculations)
Include at least three data visualizations built with highcharts.
Include at least one map. You can use Fusion Tables for this or, if you don't like fusion tables, find another mapping tool that has better results (like CartoDB or MapBox).
Include at least one other data visualization of a non-standard type (so not a line chart or bar chart or pie chart, or anything allowed by highcharts) using a javascript library or other tool NOT previously used in this class. Some types: Word cloud, treemap, network diagram, et cetera.
Include one advanced element using jQuery (i.e. scrollspy, tabbed section, slideshow carousel, et cetera).
Social sharing buttons for Facebook and Twitter with appropriate Open Graph tags.
Include a main headline, a small amount of text to set it up, and titles for each visualization and contextual text.
Include social sharing buttons for Facebook and Twitter with appropriate meta-tags.
Story Project Page Design
Similar to the Germany World Cup project and the Movies project, each data visualization should have a title and a two to three sentence writeup that provides necessary context for a reader to understand the visualization. Each of these "sections" should look the same.

As in, design it once, get it working properly, then just copy the entire section below it.

Wireframe before starting to build.

How you lay it out within that is up to you. You can do a two column design, a three column design, a one column design. Whatever you do, it should look good. It should not look like "default" Bootstrap.

Make smart use of design elements -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Design Aesthetics -- color, value, texture, shape, form, space, line and type.

Adhere to design principles -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Web Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- Contrast, Emphasis, Balance, Unity, Pattern, Movement, Rhythm and Repetition, Proportion, Simplicity and Gradation.
The design should feel smart, professional and modern.

Color should be use sparingly, primarily as accents. When in doubt, use white.

The color scheme and font scheme for all the data visualizations should work together. Do not design them independently, in this regard. For help selecting color palates that work well together, use Color Scheme Designer (Links to an external site.) or Coolors (Links to an external site.).

Footer - Use a footer with your name and copyright.

Bootstrap - Use the Bootstrap web framework, meaning you must use rows and columns.

Fonts - Use TWO google fonts, and no more than three different fonts in the document.

Media Queries - A minimum of ten style changes as a result of media queries.

Coding
Use one stylesheet for bio, resume and portfolio page.
Use individual stylesheets, one each, for Germany, Movies and Final Story.
Make use of proper folder structure.
Nest DIV tags as appropriate.
At least five CSS comments.
At least 10 html comments.
A minimum of ten style changes as a result of media queries that you write.
Use proper indentation in both HTML and CSS files.
Make sure all tags are closed.
Used descriptively named IDs and Classes.
Put javascript in the right space.
Use valid meta tags for Facebook and Twitter.
Properly Use Google Analytics Tracking Code.
Resources and Working Together
This project is 100 percent open book. You may use anything you find on the web, information from previous assignments, code from previous assignments. You may ask questions on web forums and use the answers you are provided. You may ask other classmates for help or guidance. You may work together, side-by-side. You may ask me for help as well.

If you use code from someone else on the web, you should be sure to give them credit with an HTML comment or a CSS comment. There are lots of great Boostrap Templates out there that might serve as a good starting point. Feel free to use one, though I'll expect you'll need to make a lot of custom modifications to it.

One caveat: you should NOT simply copy code from another classmate. Feel free to work together, and if you arrive at the same answer, that's fine, but DO NOT SIMPLY COPY something someone has already done. If someone asks you for help, you should try to guide them to the answer, showing how you arrived at the answer (what you searched, what forum you found, what you tried), before just giving them the answer. In other words, lay a trail of breadcrumbs to help them get there at first.
