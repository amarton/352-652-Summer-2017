## Using jQuery to add interactivity to a page

For today's assignment, you will add a button to your Germany World Cup page that, when clicked, will:
* make the legend on the world map vanish
* turn from blue to red
* change the text inside the button from "Hide legend" to "Show legend".
* When it's clicked again, all those changes are reversed. Another click makes all of the changes again, and the pattern continues for subsequent clicks.  

## Steps

### Put a small blue Bootstrap button on the page

We're going to use one of the default Bootstrap buttons.  Please use the example code for the ["Extra small" button in Bootstrap blue that appears here](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#buttons-sizes).  

Paste it just below the last paragraph tag.  Change the text from "Extra small button" to "Hide legend". Give the button an ID of "legendhide".

### Write out some pseudocode

Before you start writing any actual jQuery, it can be helpful to think through the logic in English, a process often called writing "pseudocode."

There are several ways you could go in writing a simple function to do what I've asked.  Here's how I thought of it, step-by-step, in pseudocode.

When the page loads:
* If the button is clicked:
  * Change the legend from being shown to being hidden (or vice versa)
  * Change the text in the button from "Hide Legend" to "Show Legend" (or vice versa)
  * Change the color of the button from Bootstrap blue to Bootstrap red (or vice versa).

### Modify the html and css

In the jQuery functions we write, we will make changes to HTML elements based on user actions. That will generally mean using specific IDs and classes in our jQuery functions.

To hide and unhide the legend itself, we can target .legendbox.  To change the color of the button, we can use the Bootstrap class for the red button.

Changing the text is a bit trickier.  You will likely need to add some tags inside of the button to flip back and forth between "Hide Legend" and "Show Legend", and probably some CSS.

When choosing what tags and css to add, use your pseudocode as a guide.

### Link the jQuery library and your javascript file

Your Bootstrap page should already have a link to the jQuery library. This is the "engine" that will allow all the jQuery code we use to work. The link should look something like this:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

If you don't see it, paste the above code in at the bottom of the page.  

In your "js" folder, create a file called scripts.js and link to it **below** the link to the jQuery library.

### Translate your pseudocode into real jQuery

In scripts.js, start by adding the function that will make sure our jQuery loads when the page loads

```js
$(document).ready(function() {


});
```

Everything else you write goes inside of the first curly bracket and the last curly bracket.  

As you're writing and testing, use the Chrome JavaScript console to look for problems.  And as you test ideas, you may find you need to modify the working model you created in pseudocode, or make changes to any html elements or CSS you created. 

### Submission

Save all your changes, commit them your Germany World Cup repo, submit the link on ELMS.
