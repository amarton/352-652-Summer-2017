# In-class assignment 3.2

**How to submit:** Submit the embed code for your map on ELMS. (Your homework will be to add it to your germany-world-cup page).

Today, we're going to use another Google Product, Fusion Tables (which is part of Google Drive) to build a choropleth map to layer statistical data on top of a geographic area.

I want you to build the [map on my germany-world-cup page](http://smussenden.github.io/germany-world-cup), which shows how far each country in the world progressed in the 2014 World Cup.  Each country has a different color shade depending on how far it advanced. When you click on a country, it has the country name and some text on how far it advanced.

## Important information for this assignment

You will work with a partner to create this map, working on ONE computer, taking turns at the keyboard. You should only produce one version of this map on one person's Google account.

## Required files

You will need two download two files:

This [Excel file is a spreadsheet that contains the names of countries](worldcupresults.xlsx), information on World Cup finish and other data that will help you complete the assignment.

This [KML file is a shapefile](world-countries-shapefile.kml), and it contains detailed geographic information about borders of each country. (There are lots of freely available [shapefiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) from the [Census](https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-kml.html
) you can use for future projects.

## Fusion Tables

[Fusion Tables](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232?hl=en#viz) is a plugin for Google Drive. You'll need to [activate it here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fusion-tables-experimenta/pfoeakahkgllhkommkfeehmkfcloagkl?hl=en) before you can begin.

## Instructions

1.  It's up to you to use the publicly available resources on the web to figure out how to use it. [The Fusion Tables Help Center](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/?hl=en#topic=1652595) may be of some use.  

2.  You will need to upload both of these files separately to fusion tables, then find a way to mash them together, so that the shapefile information and statistical information are in a single spreadsheet.

3.  **SHADING** The colors you should use for shading of the map (opacity set at 80 percent) are:
Champions: 000000
Finals: AD866A
Semi-finals: A8201A
Quarter-finals: EC9A29
Round of 16: 0F8B8D
Round of 32: DAD2D8
Not in World Cup: FFFFFF

4. **POP-UP BOX** In the pop-up box, the country name should be wrapped in an h2 tag, and the text in a paragraph tag.

5. **LEGEND** Do not use Fusion Tables to make the legend.  You'll build it with HTML and CSS for your homework.

## Submission

The output of your map will be an iframe, which you should upload to ELMS.
