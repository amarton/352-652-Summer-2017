# In-class assignment 3.5

## Another HighCharts exercise

Today's assignment will likely be the most challenging of the semester.  Most of you will struggle with this one, and that's the point of the exercise.  The process of struggling to find the answers is what matters here.

We'll be using HighcCarts again today.  If you need it, please refresh your memory of [how to get a basic HighChart working](../3.4/3.4-instructions.md).

You will be building the scatterplot that appears [at the bottom of this page](http://smussenden.github.io/germany-world-cup).

You can find this data [in this spreadsheet](Class-Round-Concatenate-WC-14.xlsx), a slightly modified version of you created for the Class 11 In-Class Assignment.

## Getting started

Copy the `.graphiccontainer` with an ID of four and paste it below, changing the ID to six. Put a div with an ID of "winlosschart" inside of the `.graphiccontent` div.  

At the bottom of the page, below the script tag holding the `passeschart` function, put an empty script tag, like so:

```html
<script>

</script>
```

Paste in the function from this [HighCharts example](https://www.highcharts.com/demo/scatter).  Save and refresh in the browser to make sure it's working.

## Wrangling the data

You will be plotting goals per game for each team on one axis, and goals against per game for each team on the other axis.  Here's what you should do step-by-step, in the "Goals for Scatterplot" sheet.

* In column O, use an Excel function to round Column L to one decimal place.
* In Column P, use an Excel function to round Column M to one decimal place.
* Use an Excel function to put the data in a format that works for HighCharts.  It's called [CONCATENATE](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/CONCATENATE-function-8f8ae884-2ca8-4f7a-b093-75d702bea31d) and will allow you to combine data from different columns.  This is MANDATORY. I'm going to come around and ask to see your spreadsheet with concatenated data.  

## Modifying the chart

* Replace the existing data in the sample chart with the data from your Excel file.  Test that it's working before moving on. (Hint: it might not work, and the Ivory Coast might be the reason.  Why?)
* Figure out a way to add country name to the data for each point.  I'd suggest Googling "name per point highcharts". The end result of this is that your data will be structured a little bit differently than it is in the example. You may find it easier to go back and use Excel to update your concatenate formula.
* The two point colors are "Reached Round of 16" #FF3A20 and "Eliminated in Round of 32" #7cb5ec
* You will have to figure out how to make the country name appear above each point. Try Google or the Highcharts documentation for help.
* The tooltip should have country name, goals for and goals against, as in mine, formatted as mine is. Try Google or the Highcharts documentation for help.
* The legend has moved below the chart.
* The axis names have changed, as have the title and subtitle.  
* The chart is 600px by 800px
