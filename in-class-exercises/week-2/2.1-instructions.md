# In-class assignment 2.1

**How to submit:** Commit index.html to GitHub Pages site. Put link to GitHub pages site in ELMS.

## Getting started

* A. Open GitHub Desktop, and, if you're on a new computer, clone GitHub pages repo to your desktop. If you're on the same computer, sync.
* B. Open index.html and style.css in your repo in Atom on one side of the screen.
* C. Open index.html in Google Chrome on the other side of the screen.
* D. When you make changes in index.html and style.css in Atom, refresh index.html in Chrome to see changes. This is critical.  **Get into the habit of making a single change, and refreshing in the browser to check it.**
* E. Periodically commit changes on GitHub Desktop and sync to master.  

## Detailed instructions

When you're finished with this assignment, your resume should look essentially identical to mine. Note that it changes at four preset *breakpoints*.  The picture of each is below.  

## Add this bit of code in your html document head tag

This will help the page display correctly on mobile

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

## Add empty media query containers for four breakpoints.

* Start by adding empty media query sections to the bottom of your stylesheet.  Here are the four media query breakpoints I want you to write separate queries for.
  * Extra small devices, phones (767px and smaller)
  *	Small devices, tablets (Between 768px and 991px)
  * Medium devices, desktops (Between 992px and 1199px)
  * Large devices, desktops (1200px and larger)
* Leave a comment above each section, explaining what devices/sizes the query supposed to target.

### One overall styling change.

Using `<span>` tags with a class of **.bolding**, which allow you to make changes to specific parts of a line of text without affecting the layout, set the boldness of the names of your degrees (i.e. "bachelors degree") to 600.  

## Add styling for specific sizes.

Add styling in each media query section of the document.

### Extra small devices

* Make it so that the div containing your name **#top** doesn't stay at the top as you scroll down the page.  Once you do this, you'll also need to adjust **#bottom** so it is pushed 0 pixels from the top.
* Make **#name** 3em.
* For **.alljobs** set the width so that it stretches all the way across the page, and doesn't float to the right.  Set the margins all the way around to zero.  Turn off the left border. Set the padding at 10px all the way around.
* For **.sectionheader** Set the margin at the top 10px, 15px on the bottom and center it left and right. Set the padding at 5px on the top and bottom, 10px left and right. Set the width of the element at 97 percent.  Set the minimum width at 0.  Keep the text aligned center and get rid of the existing float.
* For the lists **#degrees** and **#do**, set the margin on the top at 15px, 0px on the bottom and 2 percent on the left and right. Set the top and bottom padding at 0px and 20px left and right. The width should be full across the page, and have no float.  Set the *-webkit-padding-start* at 0px and get rid of the left border.

### For small devices

* Set the font size of **#name** to 3.6em
* Otherwise, it should look the same as the default page styles.

### For medium devices

* Set the font size of **#name** to 3.9em
* Otherwise, it should look the same as the default page styles.

### For large devices

Because we have a lot more horizontal space, we're going to bring our education and skills section in a separate column to the left. Here's what I want you to do:

* Set **#expereince** at 60 percent of the page, and push it over to the right.
* Set **#education** and **#skills** to 38.5 percent of the page and push them to the left. Also hide the overflow, just on the right and left (you may have to look up how to do this).
* For **#degrees** and **#do**, set the margin top at 15 pixels, the right and left margin at 2 percent, and the bottom at 0.  Set the width at 100 percent, and get rid of the float. The **-webkit-padding-start** should be set to 0px.  And get rid of the left border.   
* Set the margins of **.sectionheader** to 7 pixels on the top, 15 pixels on the bottom and use margin to center.  The top and bottom padding should be 5 pixels, and 10 pixels left and right.  Set the width at 97% and the minimum width down to 0px.  Get rid of the left float.
* Set the **.alljobs** width to 100 percent and get rid of the float, and set the margin all the way around to 0.  Get rid of the left border.  There should be 0 pixels of padding on the top and 10 pixels on all other sides.
