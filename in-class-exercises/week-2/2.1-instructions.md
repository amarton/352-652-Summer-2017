# In-class assignment 2.1

**How to submit:** Commit index.html to GitHub Pages site. Put link to GitHub pages site in ELMS.

## Getting started

* A. Open GitHub Desktop, and, if you're on a new computer, clone GitHub pages repo to your desktop. If you're on the same computer, sync.
* B. Open index.html and style.css in your repo in Atom on one side of the screen.
* C. Open index.html in Google Chrome on the other side of the screen.
* D. When you make changes in index.html and style.css in Atom, refresh index.html in Chrome to see changes. This is critical.  **Get into the habit of making a single change, and refreshing in the browser to check it.**
* E. Periodically commit changes on GitHub Desktop and sync to master.  

## Detailed instructions

When you're finished with this assignment, your resume should look essentially identical to mine. Note that it changes at four preset *breakpoints*.  The picture of each is below.  

## Add this bit of code in your html document head tag

This will help the page display correctly on mobile

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

## Add empty media query containers for four breakpoints.

* Start by adding empty media query sections to the bottom of your stylesheet.  Here are the four media query breakpoints I want you to write.
  * Extra small devices, phones (767px and smaller)
  *	Small devices, tablets (Between 768px and 991px)
  * Medium devices, desktops (Between 992px and 1199px)
  * Large devices, desktops (1200px and larger)
* Leave a comment above each section, explaining what devices/sizes the query supposed to target.

## Add styling for specific sizes.

Add in styling in each media queries.

### Extra small devices (767px and smaller)

* Make it so that the div containing your name **#top** doesn't stay at the top as you scroll down the page.  Once you do this, you'll also need to adjust **#bottom** so it isn't pushed so far down the page.
* Make **#name** 3em.
* For **.alljobs** set the width so that it stretches all the way across the page, and doesn't float to the right.  Set the margins all the way around to zero.  Turn off the left border. Set the padding at 10px all the way around.
* For **.sectionheader** Set the margin at the top 10px, 15px on the bottom and center it left and right. Set the padding at 5px on the top and bottom, 10px left and right. Set the width of the element at 97 percent.  Set the minimum width at 0.  Keep the text aligned center and get rid of the existing float.
* For the lists **#degrees** and **#do**, set the margin on the top at 15px, 0px on the bottom and 2 percent on the left and right. Set the top and bottom padding at 0px and 20px left and right. The width should be full across the page, and have no float.  Set the *-webkit-padding-start* at 0px and get rid of the left border.

###For small and medium devi
/*Small devices, tablets*/
@media only screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 991px) {
  /*No changes, just as designed*/

}

/*Medium devices, desktops*/
@media only screen and (min-width: 992px) and (max-width: 1199px) {
  /*No changes, just as designed*/
}


## style.css changes (Do these second)

* **body** Set the margin and padding for the body at 0.
* **#top** We're going to make a sticky header that stays put as we scroll down the page.
  * change the bottom margin to 35 pixels, leave all other sides at 0.
  * set the padding on the bottom at 10 pixels, leave all other sides at 0.
  * make the background white.
  * set the width at 100 percent.
  * set the position of the element to the value that will make it stick to the top of the page.
  * set the z-index at 1.
  * add this bit of code, which you haven't learned yet, but will add a cool design element.  After you add it, google it, see if you can figure out what the different numbers mean.  Adjust them, and see what happens. `box-shadow: 0 1px 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`   
* **#bottom** For the body of the resume, we're going to center it and leave a gutter both edges.  We also need to push it down to make space for the fixed header.
  * Adjust the existing margin value to center this element, leaving the top and bottom margin set to 0.
  * Set the position of this element to relative.  
  * Push the element 120 pixels from the top.  Do NOT use margin to achieve this.
  * Set the width of the element to 95 percent.
  * Set `height: auto;`
  * Set `overflow: auto;`
* **.sectionheader** We're creating two columns in the body of the resume, with the section headers on one side (1/3), and the content on the other (2/3).  
  * Adjust the existing margin setting to make the top margin 7 pixels.
  * float the element to the left.
  * Change the existing #hex code (#FDB020) in the border-bottom property to rgba (not rgb), and set the opacity to 0.4.  Google to find a hex to rgb converter.
* **.alljobs** This new element contains all of the *.job* elements, which we use to create a 2/3 column on the right side of the page.  
  * Set the width to 65 percent.
  * float it to the left.
  * set the left margin at 4 percent. (Note that 4 plus 65 from .alljobs plus 30 from .sectionheader = 99%).
  * add a left border that is 1 pixel, solid and has the same rgba code as .sectionheader's border, but with opacity set to .3
  * add 20 pixels of padding to the left, with all other sides set at 0.
* **#experience, #education, #skills** We're going to create "cards" for each section of our resume, using a cool bit of drop shadow. In your stylesheet, combine #experience, #education and #skills into a single section of your stylesheet, and apply the following styles to all three:
  * set the top margin to 0 pixels, the bottom to 20 pixels, and use margin to center the element.
  * set padding on all sides to 10 pixels.
  * set the width to 90 percent.
  * set `height: auto;` and `overflow: auto;`.
  * set a border all around to solid, 1 pixel and #f2f2f2.
  * Add this nifty bit of box shadow, to give it definition: `box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2);`
* **#degrees, #do** We need to make some adjustments to the lists in the education and skills sections, to match the columns in the education section above. In your stylesheet, combine #degrees and #do into a single section of your stylesheet, and apply the following styles to both:
  * Adjust the existing margin property to set the left margin to 4 percent.
  * Set the width to 65 percent.
  * Float it left.
  * Google which property to use to hide the bullets.
  * Drop in this bit of code: `-webkit-padding-start: 21px;`. What does it do?
  * Set a left border that is equal to the left border in the .alljobs div.   
  * Figure out how to put 3 pixels of space between each item in both lists.
* **.contact section**
  * Set the color of the links to #444, and figure out how to remove the underline from the links.
