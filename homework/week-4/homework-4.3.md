# Homework 4.3

A. Finish [CodeAcademy Learn jQuery](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/jquery), Section 1 "Introducing jQuery", Section 2 "jQuery Functions" and Section 3 "Dynamic HTML". Submit link to CodeAcademy achievements on ELMS in Homework 4.3.

B. To reinforce what you learned, download the [example jQuery code files](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/smussenden/352-652-Summer-2017/tree/master/guides/week-4/jquery-guides) we'll be using tomorrow. Open the index, style and script file in atom, then open in a browser. Remove the comments in the scripts file to turn on and off example jQuery to see what happens.   

C. Be aware of the [learning resources for jQuery](http://learn.jquery.com/) and the [jQuery API Documentation](http://api.jquery.com/), which covers the many methods, events and actions you can use when writing jQuery.

C. If you like, review tomorrow's [in-class assignment 4.4](../in-class-exercises/week-4/4.4/4.4-instructions.md), which will require you to write some custom jQuery.
