# Homework 2.5

Your assignment for tonight is to build a web page, using an empty Bootstrap template as a starting point, that will host all of your graphics about Germany's World Cup victory.  

You will embed your timeline on this page. And we'll add a section a day to this site over the next week and a half.

## Getting Started

In your GitHub repo, make a copy of the folder "bootstrap-starter-example" and rename it "germany-world-cup".  Open index.html and customstyles.css in Atom.

## HTML structure and CSS

You should make the page look exactly like this: [Germany's Run to World Cup Victory](http://seanmussenden.github.io). Please note I've made space for the next graphic. You have free access to my source code, so please review it to see how the page was built.  

## Submission

When you're finished, commit the changes to GitHub and submit the link to your site on ELMS.
