# Homework 2.5

**If you haven't finished in-class assignment 2.5, finish that first, then start on this homework.**

Your weekend homework is designed as a very basic introduction to data journalism and newsroom statistics, and to introduce you to -- or provide a refresher on -- using Excel, perhaps the most widely used tool for data analysis in journalism.  This lesson will help you perform simple calculations and "interview" data sets to find stories.  

Plus, you will use need to use Excel for several upcoming in-class assignments, the take-home portion of your mid-term and your final project.  

## Data Journalism Background
Read general background on the nature of data journalism by reading the introduction of the [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction.html), specifically the first five sections
* [What is Data Journalism](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_0.html)
* [Why Journalists Should Use Data](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_1.html)
* [Why is Data Journalism Important](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_2.html)
* [Some Favorite Examples](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_3.html)
* [Data Journalism in Perspective](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/introduction_4.html)

## Excel Tutorial

Watch [Excel for Mac Essential Training](http://www.lynda.com/Excel-2011-for-mac-tutorials/essential-training/71210-2.html), a Lynda.com course that is FREE if you log in [through the university system](http://lyndatraining.umd.edu). You should watch sections 1-4 (Getting Started with Excel; Managing Workbooks; Managing Worksheets, Cells and Cell Data, Summarizing Data Using Formulas and Functions).

This will give you the basics on technical functions of Excel that you'll need to know for this class. If you are already very familiar with the following aspects of Excel, you may want to just breeze through as a refresher. These are the critical things you'll need to know.

Play close attention to instructions on how to open and create worksheets, select cells and move around data, sorting, filtering and using formulas and functions.  Here are more details on key formulas and functions.

## Practice analyzing a data set with Excel, then upload to ELMS.

Download this [Excel file of World Cup 2014 data](excel-training-wc-2014.xlsx).  

This is a spreadsheet of data listing all 32 teams in the 2014 World Cup</a>, with a column for number of matches played, goals for, goals against, total shots (on and off goal), total shots on goal and total shots off goal.

At the bottom of the data sheet are five questions you'll need to answer. You will need to write formulas, create new columns and sort to get the answers required.

Fill in the cells with the appropriate answer. Save the spreadsheet and upload it to ELMS.
