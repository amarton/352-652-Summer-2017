# Homework 3.2

Your homework is to add the embed code for the Google Map you created to your Germany World Cup page.

## Create a new section

Create a new section of your html document.  Make a copy of the ```graphiccontainer``` with an ID of two, and paste it below, with an ID of three.  

## Add text

Here's the text to add to the page along with it:

```html
Team Faced Tough Global Foes

Germany met tough competition in the later rounds of the tournament, especially from South America and Europe.

Every World Cup champion has come from those two continents. And their dominance continued in 2014, as this map shows, with all four semi-finalists hailing from South America or Europe (Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Netherlands).

## Add a legend

Use your understanding of HTML and CSS to build a legend that looks identical to the [one on this page](http://smussenden.github.io). Use the Google Chrome web developer to inspect it. Note that the legend should stay affixed to the bottom left corner of the map as the page resizes.

In order to recreate it, use the Google Chrome Web Developer to figure out how it was built. If you are really stuck, use view source on the page to look at the CSS.  

## Submission
Commit the changes to your GitHub repo, and submit the link to your Germany World Cup page on ELMS.
