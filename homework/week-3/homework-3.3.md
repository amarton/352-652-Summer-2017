# Homework 3.3

Your homework is to add your findings from in-class assignment 3.3 to your page.

## Create a new section

Create a new section of your html document.  Make a copy of the ```graphiccontainer``` with an ID of three, and paste it below, with an ID of four.  Delete the map iframe and the code for the legend.  Delete the graphic title and the text in the left column.  

## Add text

Here's the title and text to add to the left column:

```html
How Germany Won

Germany won the World Cup by controlling the ball with more crisp passes than any other team in the tournament, taking more high percentage shots and scoring buckets of goals while keeping their opponents from finding the back of the net.

```

## Add your findings in the right column

Using paragraph tags -- one paragraph tag per two sentence finding -- add your findings to the page. 

## Submission
Commit the changes to your GitHub repo, and submit the link to your Germany World Cup page on ELMS.
