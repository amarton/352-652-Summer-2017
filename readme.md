## Course Overview

This is a journalism course in which you will learn to tell stories with code.

In this course, you will learn the basics of markup with HTML and CSS, and web programming with javascript. You'll learn a bit about digital design, data analysis and data visualization. If you're interested in a career as a web designer, web developer, data journalist, news graphics editor, this course provides a nice foundation for further education.  Even if you choose another career path, the basic skills and concepts taught here will serve you well.

The class will include lectures, self-directed learning modules and in-class laboratory sessions. You'll learn to design and build websites, do basic data analysis, visualize data and develop web applications -- all in a journalism context.

This is a very hands on class; you should expect to be coding or using digital tools during and between classes. It's also a conceptual class, where you'll learn how to determine the best way of telling a story using available tools.

**This class requires a lot of work. If you're not prepared to do a lot of work in class and out of class, this is the wrong class for you.**

We will be working a lot in teams, so be prepared for that. The work we do in this class will be fun, but also frequently frustrating. You may bang your head against the wall for hours trying to get some code to work. That's just the nature of this kind of work. You must learn to fight through the frustration.

I will frequently let you struggle instead of just handing you the answer, forcing you to find try different ways to solve a problem. I won't be there to hold your hand in the future, so I want to equip you with the skills you'll need to figure out things on your own.  A big part of this class -- and coding -- is learning how to learn to problem solve.

## Learning Outcomes

Students will learn to:
* Design and construct web pages using HTML and CSS, using effective visual design principles;
* Visualize data in a straightforward, accurate and visually compelling manner;
* Learn introductory programming techniques to add interactivity to web pages and visualize data;
* Learn how to solve thorny coding problems by getting help from classmates and the huge community of programmers on the Web;
* Use version control tools to manage files and upload files to a webserver;
* Tap into the large, publicly available open source repositories of code packages and interactive tools to help tell better stories.
* Use resources to continue improving as a coder/data journalist after the class ends;
* Compose, edit and compress photos using Photoshop;
* Determine which storytelling platforms and tools – text, video, audio, photos, graphics – work best for which type of story;
* Combine text, graphics, images, design elements, interactive features and multimedia to tell stories.

## Your Professor

Sean Mussenden has been on the faculty of the Philip Merrill College of Journalism since 2009, mainly teaching courses in digital journalism, data journalism and web development. With some other faculty, he directs a student-powered news organization run by the Merrill College -- Capital News Service. Students working under his direction  have won dozens of regional and national journalism awards.

Mussenden graduated from the Merrill College in 2000. From 2000-2005, he worked as a statehouse reporter, business desk reporter and Washington correspondent for the Orlando Sentinel, with a speciality in data journalism. Before joining the Merrill College in 2009, he was a multimedia Washington correspondent and Web producer/editor for Media General News Service, where he specialized in data-driven stories.

He started his career as a print newspaper reporter, but taught himself to code.  He builds websites, web applications, interactive graphics and data visualizations and teaches students to do the same.  He feels strongly that if he can learn to code, then you can too, if you want it bad enough.

## Attendance

**It is absolutely essential -- ESSENTIAL -- that you come to class and be here on time every single day.** We have a lot of material to pack into the next six weeks. The material in this class is carefully structured to build progressively throughout the semester.

With few exceptions, everything you learn in this class will build on a concept introduced in a prior class. On most days, there will likely be a graded, in-class lab assignment every single day, which you will not be able to make up except in the case of an excused absence.

If you must be absent from class due to medical conditions, please notify me before class. More than one miss, and you'll need to bring documentation of your illness from a health care professional. A miss on a day of a test or a day when an assignment is due will require a note from a health care professional; on long-term assignments, the deadline will stand firm despite a short-term illness.

I will post notes to ELMS to notify you of any class time or assignment changes due to blizzards, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods or other disasters. When in doubt, please check ELMS or email me before setting out. In addition, the university website posts notices about campus closings; if the university is closed, we may meet electronically or reschedule.

There will be no tests or major assignments scheduled on religious holidays identified by the university. If you expect to miss a class due to a religious holiday, please notify me in writing before the start of the second class.

## Assessment

This affects undergraduates only. JOUR 352 is assessed as part of the college’s learning outcomes assessment program, http://www.jportfolio.umd.edu, which helps us identify areas in the curriculum that need updates or improvements. Assessment is required by the university and is reviewed by the college’s accreditation body. Students enrolled in JOUR 352 will be required to upload a link to their final multimedia project to the J-Portfolio website. The assignment is identified in your class schedule. I will remind you when it is time to upload. The assignment will be rated using a five-point system that considers how well students write, report, code and integrate multimedia into their storytelling. The assessment scores do not affect any student’s grade in this class; however, students who do not post the required assignment onto J-Portfolio will not receive a grade for this class until it is posted.

## Standards, Ethics and Academic Integrity

Along with certain rights, students have the responsibility to behave honorably in an academic environment. Academic dishonesty, including cheating, fabrication, facilitating academic dishonesty and plagiarism, will not be tolerated. Adhering to a high ethical standard is of special importance in journalism, where reliability and credibility are the cornerstones of the field.

Therefore, the college has adopted a “zero tolerance” policy on academic dishonesty. Any abridgment of academic integrity standards in a College of Journalism course will be referred to the university’s Student Honor Council (see http://www.shc.umd.edu ) and the college's deans. To insure this is understood, all students are asked to sign an academic integrity pledge at the beginning of the semester that will cover all assignments in this course. Students found to have violated the university's honor code may face sanctions, including a grade of XF for the course, suspension or expulsion from the university.

For this class, you must do all work yourself, without collaboration with classmates or others, unless I tell you otherwise. For many in-class assignments, you will be working with a partner, and this collaboration is fine. And outside of class, it's also fine to ask each other questions, to get help with conceptual matters and to post questions to the class discussion board (which classmates will get extra credit for answering). I just don't want you copying answers from someone or writing code for someone else. A good rule is "if this feels like I might be getting myself in trouble" email or text Sean and ask. It's always better to ask for permission first then ask for forgiveness later.

Also, please keep in mind that academic dishonesty could include use of unauthorized photos, graphics, text or layout from the Web in your projects. Ask if you're not sure.  The university's Code of Academic Integrity sets standards for all undergraduate and graduate students.

## Required Materials

You will probably not need to spend any money on course materials. We will be using a combination of free online step-by-step tutorials, video tutorials, digital readings, free software and other materials.  

You will need to register for free accounts on the following sites

* [Code Academy](http://codeacademy.com), a coding tutorial site
* [GitHub](http://github.com), for version control and web hosting
* [Lynda](http://lynda.com), for online learning videos
* [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com), for data analysis and visualization

The software you need for this class is installed on Merrill computers.  I strongly encourage you to use the classroom computers while you're in class, and while you're in class, this is the software I want you to use. In case you want to use your personal laptop, this is the software you'll need.  

* [Atom](https://atom.io/), a syntax highlighting text editor.  
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html), a web browser. Please don't use Firefox, Chrome or IE.  We use chrome because it has a superior suite for debugging.
* [GitHub for Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), for version control and uploading to the web.

As with every other journalism course at Maryland, you will need either an updated copy of the Associated Press Stylebook and Libel Manual or an online subscription to the AP stylebook.

## Students with Special Needs

Students with a specific disability (permanent or temporary, physical or learning) needing special accommodation during the semester should make an appointment to meet with the instructor immediately after the first class. Students may be asked to provide the instructor accommodation forms given to them after testing by the Disability Support Service on campus, 301-405-0813.

### Grade breakdown details

**Homework (10 percent):** You will have homework on most nights during this course.  They will be graded 0 (failure to do) 1 (unsatisfactorily completed), 2 (satisfactorily completed). You will not be able to make these up unless you have an excused absence.

**In-Class Exercises (15 percent):** Except for workshop days, we will have graded in-class assignments most day. They are due at the end of class, but if you need more time you have until midnight to complete and submit them. They will be graded 0 (failure to do) 1 (unsatisfactorily completed), 2 (satisfactorily completed). You will not be able to make these up unless you have an excused absence.

**Completed Personal Resume (10 percent):** This will build on the work we do in the first week of class, and will be the foundation for the personal portfolio site that will live on your domain.  A grading rubric will be provided and it will be assigned a grade from 0-100.

**Mid-Term (20 percent):** There are two parts.  The first will be a closed book, no web assistance test on extremely basic coding concepts that we've learned in first three weeks of class.  Most people ace this thing, if they've been at all paying attention. It's more like a quiz than a true test, and it's worth 5 percent (It will be graded from 0-100).  The second part will be an open book, open collaboration test and it's worth 15 percent.  You'll use all of your new skills in web design, interactive design and data analysis and data visualization to produce a single page visual story.  You'll get much more info on this as it approaches. It will prepare you for your final project. A grading rubric will be provided and it will be assigned a grade of 0-100.

**Final Project (40 percent of your grade broken up across several weeks):** For your final project, you will build out your site with a completed resume, a portfolio page, a bio introduction page and a single page data-driven storytelling project based on one of several topics provided to you by your instructor.  Much more information will be provided about the single page package in the coming weeks, but it will require you to incorporate everything you've learned in this class -- along with previously acquired reporting skills -- to complete.  The completed package is worth 22 percent of your grade, and a series of drafts due along the way -- and a brief presentation on the final day -- will be worth another 18 percent of your grade.
