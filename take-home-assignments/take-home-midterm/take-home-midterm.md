# Take-Home mid-term

*This assignment is due Friday, July 21 at the start of class.*

You will draw on all that you have learned about building websites with HTML and CSS -- and exercise your creative muscles -- to rebuild your resume from scratch using a design of your own creation.

This resume will form the first page of your professional resume and portfolio site that will be completed by the end of the semester.

You may work ask me and your classmates for assistance in completing the assignment, but your work should be your own.  

**Please read the entire assignment guidelines before beginning.**

## GUIDELINES (What you will be graded on)

### DESIGN

* Make smart use of design elements -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- color, value, texture, shape, form, space, line and type.
* Adhere to design principles -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Web Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- Contrast, Emphasis, Balance, Unity, Pattern, Movement, Rhythm and Repetition, Proportion, Simplicity and Gradation.
* It should NOT look like the resume we spent the last week designing. You should start from scratch. While you may reuse the text from your existing resume, you should not reuse any of the code.
* The design should feel smart, professional and modern. Color should be use sparingly, primarily as accents. When in doubt, use white. For help selecting color palates that work well together, use [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/) or [Coolors]( href="http://coolors.co/")

### DESIGN INSPIRATION
* You are free to take inspiration from HTML/CSS resume templates that are available on the web. Google HTML CSS resume template and you will find thousands of examples designed by professionals. **Under no circumstances should you simply use one of these templates in its entirety.**
* It may be helpful to use view source or the Google Web developer inspector to look at the code. In most cases, their code will be significantly more advanced than you are capable of producing at this point. View source will give you insight into how a section was built.
* If your final design is inspired by one or more pages give credit in your resume -- on your html page and your stylesheet -- as a comment.
* If you're unsure about whether what you're doing constitutes too much borrowing, ask me in advance.
* To get you started, here are some interesting ones. (Note that some of these contain interactivity and you're not expected to have that):
  * [Example 1](http://sampleresumetemplate.net/)
  * [Example 2](https://css-tricks.com/examples/OnePageResume/)
  * [Example 3](http://html.metrothemes.me/md-html/md-live/index-1.html)
  * [Example 4](http://www.dotrex.co/vertica/themes/james.html)  
  * [Example 5](http://themeforest.nazwa.pl/resume-timeline/)
  * [Example 6](http://shifthtml.themerex.net/)
  * [Example 7](http://qbkl.net/themeforest/bold2/)
  * [Example 8](http://mythemepreviews.com/cleanbusiness-html/blue/)
  * [Example 9](http://www.bitpublimedia.ro/themeforest/resume-v2/index-1.html)

### Required Structural and Design Elements

* Complete a site wireframe before starting to build and have it approved by me.
* A section for education, experience and skills.  You are free to include any other sections you wish.
* A thin, top-bar navigation menu with "Your Name", "Resume" and "Portfolio" as menu items.  You should modify the default Bootstrap menu that comes with the starter template so that it integrates with your styles.
* A header with your name, contact information and affiliated sites.
* A page footer with your name, copyright information.  
* At least one Google Font family and no more than two total font families.

### Required Coding Elements

* Uses the [Bootstrap grid system](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid).  The resume should look good at all four default Bootstrap device breakpoints. You should have a media query for each of the four breakpoints, and make at least one change in each breakpoint range.  You should have, at a minimum, 10 properties that change.
* Store custom styles in a separate stylesheet from the core Boostrap stylesheet. Make sure to link to your custom styles stylesheet BELOW the core Bootstrap stylesheet.
* At least 15 CSS comments
* At least 10 HTML comments
* Use proper indentation in HTML and CSS.
* Avoid using "heading" tags.  
* Make sure all tags are closed.  
* Use class and ID tags that are descriptive.

* Incorporate an element that allows visitors to share your resume to LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. +5 percent.


*********************

The second part of our mid-term exam is a take-home exam. It is designed to test your mastery of the concepts and skills you've learned in this class during the first few weeks, including:

Practicing principles of good web design.
Building web pages that look good on a range of devices.
Using HTML, CSS and basic Javascript.
Finding stories using data.
Using Excel for data analysis.
Selecting the right technique to visualize data and telling compelling visual stories.
Building interactive maps with Google Fusion Tables.
Building interactive timelines with Timelines.js.
Building interactive charts with Highcharts.
The ability to debug problems using resources available on the web.
This exam will reinforce these skills, preparing you to complete your final project.

RESOURCES
This exam is 100 percent open book. You may use anything you find on the web, information from previous assignments, code from previous assignments. You may ask questions on web forums and use the answers you are provided. You may ask other classmates for help or guidance. You may work together, side-by-side. You may ask me for help as well.

If you use code from someone else on the web, you should be sure to give them credit with an HTML comment or a CSS comment. There are lots of great Boostrap Templates out there that might serve as a good starting point. Feel free to use one, though I'll expect you'll need to make a lot of custom modifications to it.

One caveat: you should NOT simply copy code from another classmate. Feel free to work together, and if you arrive at the same answer, that's fine, but DO NOT SIMPLY COPY something someone has already done. If someone asks you for help, you should try to guide them to the answer, showing how you arrived at the answer (what you searched, what forum you found, what you tried), before just giving them the answer. In otherwords, lay a trail of breadcrumbs to help them get there at first.

ABOUT THE PROJECT: 352/652 Goes to the Movies!
For the last week and a half, we've been building a single page project that told the story of Germany's 2014 World Cup win using a variety of data visualization techniques.

Today, we leave soccer behind and head to the movies! Consider this an exercise in data-driven entertainment journalism.

This mid-term exam will require you to build a single page story project that takes a closer look at our favorite movies -- as measured by IMDB ratings and ticket sales -- using a variety of data visualization techniques. Your final product will look similar to your Germany 2014 World Cup page, but with a different layout and different content.

You will need to do some data analysis, build each of the elements listed here, write some supporting text and design and build a website to contain them.

DUE DATE, IN-CLASS WORKSHOP and SUBMISSION
This project is due at the end of class, on Tuesday, August 2.

You will push the final project to your server and submit a link, which should look like YOURSITE.com/favorite-movies/index.html. And in a comment, you'll submit the link to the edited Excel workbook you used for this project, which should be YOURSITE.com/favorite-movies/data.xlsx. You must submit BOTH links.

Before submitting, make sure you have followed the instructions for this assignment EXACTLY. You will lose points if you don't follow instructions.

Monday's class will be an in-class workshop where you can work on the exam, ask questions of others and me.

It's up to you how you use this classtime, but if I were you here's what I'd do: try and complete as much of the project as possible this weekend. Come in ready to tackle the things you are having trouble figuring out, not to start building the project.

THE DATA
All the data you'll need to complete this project is in this workbook mid-term-movies.xlsx. You will need to sort, filter and write formulas to arrive at the answers needed to build the visualizations.

For each visualization, I want you to create a new spreadsheet in the workbook and copy in the data you'll need to work with for that visualization. Do NOT edit the original spreadsheets.

I want to see the data analysis work -- the formulas you've written -- to arrive at the answers. And for the highcharts visualizations I'll want to see the CONCATENATE column you've written to arrive at the properly structured data.

You should include your edited workbook in your final project folder so I can see your work.  Remember, you will be submitting a link to both the final project and the data.

DATA VISUALIZATION ELEMENTS
You will build the following elements and include them on the page.  With each, as with the Germany World Cup project, you'll have a title for the visualization and two to three sentences of context to help readers understand the visualization.

1. An interactive timeline, with the following requirements:

Uses Timeline.js
An introductory slide with a Title of "Top Grossing Movies for Each Decade" and a Subtitle of "A look at the most popular movies -- by gross ticket sales, adjusted for inflation into current dollars -- for each of the last 10 decades. Source: Box Office Mojo." Box Office Mojo should link here: http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/adjusted.htm
One slide for each decade - 1920, 1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010.
Each slide should have a title with the name of the movie, and text (each element on a new line) Year: Four-Digit-Year, Inflation Adjusted Gross: Figure, Unadjusted Gross: Figure)
Each slide should have a picture from the movie (movie poster, still image) taken from Wikimedia Commons (Wikipedia's image service) or a movie clip from YouTube, with attribution that links back to the original source.
The date for each slide should be Jan. 1 of the year the movie was released.
The spreadsheet for this should show evidence of filtering, sorting and ranking.
2. An interactive map, with the following requirements:

Uses Google Fusion Tables.
Displays the top 20 international box office market countries 2014 ticket sales, adjusted for population (per 1,000 people).
Shades the 20 countries in five color buckets, using a smartly selected color scheme of your choice that works with rest of data visualizations on the page and the page itself.
Shades all other countries not on the list a light gray.
A popup window that looks like this (not with bullets, just new lines for each one)
Country Name in bold
(bold) 2014 Spending on Movies per person: (not in bold)figure
(bold) Total Movie Spending in 2014: (not in bold) $figure billion
(bold) 2014 Population: (not in bold) figure million.
Includes a legend placed over the map, built using HTML and CSS, similar to the one we designed in class.
Below the chart, in HTML, Source: MPAA and Population Data Source (with MPAA linked here:http://www.mpaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/MPAA-Theatrical-Market-Statistics-2014.pdf, and Population Data Source replaced with online source for population data and a link to that source).
The spreadsheet for this should show evidence of population data you acquire, per capita calculation.
3. A chart, with the following requirements:

Uses highcharts.
Shows the total number of movies in the IMDB top 250 by decade, with one data point for each decade.
Uses an appropriate chart type for change over time.
Uses datalabels.
Has a separate line, called a plot line, indicating the median number for all decades.
Uses tooltips formatter to make each tooltip say "There were X movies in the IMDB top 250 in DECADE".
Uses X and Y axis titles.
Uses ONE COLOR for the data points that works with the rest of the data visualizations on the page and the page itself, and ANOTHER COLOR for the plot line.
The spreadsheet for this should show evidence of filtering, sorting, counting, median and should include a concatenate function.
Give a credit of "IMDB Top 250 Movies"
4. A chart, with the following requirements:

Uses highcharts.
For films in both the IMDB top 250 and Box Office Mojo Top Adjusted Gross of All Time, show how many movies by each director are on both lists. Only include directors with two or movies on both lists. For Disney/Pixar cartoons, don't group by director, group by "Disney/Pixar." They should be listed in order from most to least.
Uses an appropriate chart type for comparison.
Uses datalabels of number of movies on both lists.
Uses tooltips formatter to make each tooltip say "DIRECTOR had X movies on the IMDB Top 250 and Box Office Mojo Top 200 Adjusted Grossing Movies".
Uses X and Y axis titles.
Uses ONE COLOR that works with the rest of the data visualizations on the page and the page itself.
Give a credit of "IMDB Top 250 Movies and Box Office Mojo Top Adjusted Gross Income Films."
The spreadsheet for this should show evidence of filtering, sorting and counting and should include a concatenate function.
5. A chart, with the following requirements:

Uses highcharts.
Compares the adjusted gross income of each of the six Star Wars movies with the IMDB ranking for each of the six movies.
Uses an appropriate chart type for comparison of two variables.
Uses TWO COLORS, that work with the rest of the data visualizations on the page and the page itself. The three elements for the "original" three movies should be one color and the "new" (TERRIBLE) movies should be another color.
Puts the name of the movie as a data label.
Uses X and Y axis titles.
Has a legend.
Uses tooltips formatter to make each tooltip say (just breaks between each line, not bullets):
(bold) MOVIE TITLE
(bold)IMDB Ranking: (not bold)X
(bold)Gross Income 2015 Dollars: (not bold) Y
Give a credit of "IMDB Top 250 Movies and Box Office Mojo Top Adjusted Gross Income Films"
The spreadsheet for this should show evidence of a concatenate function.
6. A chart, with the following requirements:

Uses highcharts.
Visualizes something interesting of your own analysis from the given data.  It should make a discreet editorial point that is "newsworthy" or "surprising."
Uses an appropriate chart type for the given point you are trying to make.
Uses a color scheme that works with the rest of the data visualizations on the page and the page itself.
Uses data labels.
Has tooltips.
uses X and Y Axis Titles.
A credit of the source of the data.
The spreadsheet should, at a minimum, contain a concatenate function.
TEXT
The page should have a title of "A Visual Look at Our Favorite Movies"
The page should have a subitle of "There are movies we think are good and movies we all pay to go see. These movies are not always the same. This is a visual look at our favorite movies, using IMDB ratings and data of box office ticket sales (adjusted for inflation) from Box Office Mojo."
It should have your byline.
PAGE DESIGN
Similar to the Germany World Cup project, each data visualization should have a title and a two to three sentence writeup that provides necessary context for a reader to understand the visualization. Each of these "sections" should look the same.  As in, design it once, get it working properly, then just copy the entire section below it.
Wireframe before starting to build.  You may find these sheets helpful.   
How you lay it out within that is up to you. Your final product should look DIFFERENT than the Germany World Cup page.  You can do a two column design, a three column design, a one column design.  Whatever you do, it should look good.  
Make smart use of design elements -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Design Aesthetics -- color, value, texture, shape, form, space, line and type.
Adhere to design principles -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Web Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- Contrast, Emphasis, Balance, Unity, Pattern, Movement, Rhythm and Repetition, Proportion, Simplicity and Gradation.
The design should feel smart, professional and modern.
Color should be use sparingly, primarily as accents. When in doubt, use white.
The color scheme and font scheme for all the data visualizations should work together. Do not design them independently, in this regard. For help selecting color palates that work well together, use Color Scheme Designer or Coolors. For help selecting Google Fonts that work together, try this page or this page.
It should look good at the four breakpoints that are part of the Bootstrap framework  (Mobile phones, browser less than 768px; Tablets, 768px - 991px; Small desktops, 992px - 1199px; Large desktops, greater than 1200px).
The page should WORK at all sizes, with appropriate margin and padding, things should line up correctly. It should not look BROKEN. You will lose a lot of points if it looks broken.
REQUIRED DESIGN ELEMENTS
Menu - Use a top menu similar to the one on your Germany World Cup Page. Text Should Read "Our Favorite Movies" with the word TOP and numbers after it, one number for each visualization. When you click on those numbers, the page should jump down to that section.  Hint: you'll need to use something called anchor tags. Look it up.
Footer - Use a footer with your name and copyright.
Bootstrap - Use the Boostrap web framework, meaning you must use rows and columns.
Fonts - Use TWO google fonts, and no more than three different fonts in the document.
Media Queries - A minimum of ten style changes as a result of media queries.
CODING
Make use of proper folder structure.
Nest DIV tags as appropriate.
At least five CSS comments.
At least 10 html comments.
A minimum of ten style changes as a result of media queries that you write.
Use proper indentation in both HTML and CSS files.
Make sure all tags are closed.
Used descriptively named IDs and Classes.
Put Javascript in the right space.
