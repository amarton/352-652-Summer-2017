# Personal Resume Assignment

*This assignment is due Friday, July 21 at the start of class.*

You will draw on all that you have learned about building websites with HTML and CSS -- and exercise your creative muscles -- to rebuild your resume from scratch using a design of your own creation.

This resume will form the first page of your professional resume and portfolio site that will be completed by the end of the semester.

You may work ask me and your classmates for assistance in completing the assignment, but your work should be your own.  

**Please read the entire assignment guidelines before beginning.**

## GUIDELINES (What you will be graded on)

### DESIGN

* Make smart use of design elements -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- color, value, texture, shape, form, space, line and type.
* Adhere to design principles -- as described in the Lynda.com course on Web Design Aesthetics for Web Design -- Contrast, Emphasis, Balance, Unity, Pattern, Movement, Rhythm and Repetition, Proportion, Simplicity and Gradation.
* It should NOT look like the resume we spent the last week designing. You should start from scratch. While you may reuse the text from your existing resume, you should not reuse any of the code.
* The design should feel smart, professional and modern. Color should be use sparingly, primarily as accents. When in doubt, use white. For help selecting color palates that work well together, use [Color Scheme Designer](http://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/) or [Coolors]( href="http://coolors.co/")

### DESIGN INSPIRATION
* You are free to take inspiration from HTML/CSS resume templates that are available on the web. Google HTML CSS resume template and you will find thousands of examples designed by professionals. **Under no circumstances should you simply use one of these templates in its entirety.**
* It may be helpful to use view source or the Google Web developer inspector to look at the code. In most cases, their code will be significantly more advanced than you are capable of producing at this point. View source will give you insight into how a section was built.
* If your final design is inspired by one or more pages give credit in your resume -- on your html page and your stylesheet -- as a comment.
* If you're unsure about whether what you're doing constitutes too much borrowing, ask me in advance.
* To get you started, here are some interesting ones. (Note that some of these contain interactivity and you're not expected to have that):

* A section for education, experience and skills.  You are free to include any other sections you wish.
